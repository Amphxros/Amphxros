## About my experience 💻

I have some knowledge of C, C# and C++ mainly but I also have some little knowledge of JS and HTML.

I only worked in the development of a game, [Fighter Traighter 🍂](https://github.com/MoruyankiiFighter/FighterTraighter) an arcade fighting game made in C++ using some libraries like the SDL ones and Box2D for the physics, where I made almost all of the art, UI and some programming parts.

Also I have a little bit of experience in serious games thanks to a college subject, where I made [APTA 🌼](https://github.com/Juegos-Serios/ProyectFinal), in this game I made many programming parts and some of the art.
